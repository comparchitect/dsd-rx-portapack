MBELIB decoder is shipped without mbelib-derived voice decoding tables or code.

To enable decoding you must obtain mbelib yourself and rebuild the external MBELIB baseband
using the provided fetch/patch script (see repository docs). By installing mbelib you accept
its terms of use. The maintainers of this firmware do not distribute mbelib.

If you do not install mbelib, MBELIB will remain stubbed and will not decode audio.
